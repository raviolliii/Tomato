# To Do List - Google Chrome Extension

** A simple To Do List as a Google Chrome Extension **

### Description

It's basically a Google Chrome Extension that replaces the new tab page with a custom one. The new one has a to do list integrated (supports sync) made with React.

### Usage

The project is not in the Chrome Web Store since it's relatively simple (I really only made this to get familiar with React), but if you would like to use it:
1. Download the project
2. Go to Chrome Settings > Extensions > Select Developer Mode
3. Click the Load Unpacked button, then select the downloaded project

### Notice

This project is still in development, so check back for updates if you're interested.
